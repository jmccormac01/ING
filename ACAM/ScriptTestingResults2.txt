Bugs:
1) In v2.0 of multdither I added a "Press Enter" after displaying the abort procedure. 
This "Press Enter" then stops mcol every time it calls multdither. Remove it!
2) When running mcol with "test" is does not pass the 2nd OB to my script, check with JMA.

Improvements for next version:
multdither:
- run "autoguide off" as subprocess to surpress the crap it outputs on command line
- create a log of all outputs and errors

mcol:
- don't give the filter names in the "name", the script does this already
- check the focus is not moving after filter change before running an image
- run "acamimage X" as a subprocess to surpress the crap is outputs on the command line
- create a log of all outputs and errors


autoflat: running from ~/acam/jmcc/under_development/autoflat/

python autoflat.py acam 3 slow SlnG SlnI   --- good
