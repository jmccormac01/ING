## Synopsis

A dump of all my ING scripts at the time of leaving. 

## Code Info

I wrote scripts for automated flat fielding, dithered observations with/without autoguiding and support for multiple filters, a system to control an Orion SSAG camera on the seeing monitor. <br/>

This code is in a mixture of complete/incomplete states. I suggest that you contact me if you want to use any of it. I've included it here mainly as reference material.

## Motivation

Lots of things can be automated and sped up, this was an attempt at some of them.

## Installation

This code will likely not run outside the ING computer environment, it is here for reference only. 

## API Reference

N/A

## Tests

None
